											<h3 class="major">Online grocery store interface redesign</h3>
											<p>I remotely collaborated on a team of four people to redesign the interface for online grocery shopping. We extensively used user interviews and user co-design sessions to assure that experiences users valued in a traditional grocery store settings were being accounted for and that the experience was intuitive and natural for users to use.</p>
											<p>I also used HTML and CSS to develop and maintain a website which we use to showcase the work we performed on the project, as well as a functional Figma prototype of our online store interface.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Website Showcase For an autonomous turret</h3>
											<p>This is a website I developed in collaboration with three teammates to showcase the work we we performed for an autonomous sentry turret which we developed. We used HTML and CSS to program the back end components of the website. Myself and one teammate maintain the site and keep it functional</p>

											<h3 class="major">Sound Labyrinth Website</h3>
											<p>I work with one other person to develop and maintain this website with Html and CSS to showcase the work i did on an accessible video game. The game is a dungeon crawler video game which is designed to provide the same User Experience through both visual and Audio queues. Thus it provides the same experience to users regardless of their visual or audio ability.</p>
